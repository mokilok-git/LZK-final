# LZK-final

Basic webapp to fetch current rates from the Kraken-Api and store them in the local storage of the browser:  
<a href="https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Ticker?pair=XBTEUR">Kraken</a>  
-[x] The current rate can be fetched and will be updatet every 3 minutes  
-[x] The EUR amount can be entered and is stored  
-[x] Invalid (not numbers) entries will throw an error and a warning  

TO BE DONE  
-[ ]An Alert function will be implemented in case the rate exceeds/ falls below a stored value (probably a pop-up window preferrd to a browser nofication) 
-[ ]The fetched rate @Kraken should be shown in realtime (week/month); the local stored values should be displayed as a straight line (as a reference to the rate graph)
-[ ]The past stored values can be shown as a graph  
-[ ]Layout: BTC Icon should be shown @website and @browser tab (favicon)
